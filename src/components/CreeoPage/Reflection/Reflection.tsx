          Designing Creeo has been both an exhilarating and challenging
          experience, I learned a lot because, I had to wear many hats as a
          designer, I did some fun illustrations, played with Blender 3D, did
          motion graphics. As I reflect on the processes that led to the final
          product, I am proud of the outcome and the impact it has on NFT
          creators.

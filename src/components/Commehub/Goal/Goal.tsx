          The paramount goal was to design a user-centric app for{" "}
          <span>retailers, and consumers</span> to engage in group purchases. At
          this point my goal was not to jump into ideation concepts based on
          assumptions. Instead, I wanted to understand as much of group
          purchasing experience as I could in this limited amount of time to
          make sure my concept was effective and valuable to users, after which
          I designed on

        <div className={classes.description}>
          According to my research I identified two target audience(Primary &
          Secondary). <span>PRIMARY</span> consists of retailers, while
          <span>SECONDARY</span> consists of final consumer. So, to better
          understand the needs and motivations of users Iâ€™m designing for I
          conducted <span>quantitative</span> and <span>qualitative</span>{" "}
          research starting with{" "}
          <span className={classes.accent}>user interviews</span> and{" "}
          <span className={classes.accent}>survey</span>. I decided to first
          talk to 5 small business owners/trades in my network in an interview.
          I then moved to expanding that number to 25 persons in an online
          survey. I ensure that diversity was taken into considerations by
          recruiting people of different age and trades for better
          generalizability. Below are some of the results of my survey.

          The audience turned out to be mostly middle-aged people from 20 - 40
          years, and most of the users already had experience ordering products
          online. Some key charts are presetned below
